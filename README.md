# HTML5 version of chriscorchado.com

The goal is to use plain HTML, CSS and Javascript to build my personal portfolio/resume site. In order to make use of modern libraries this site is using Bootstrap which currently requires JQuery.

When the version of Bootstrap gets released that is not dependent on Jquery this codebase will be refactored to use plain Javascript.
